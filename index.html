            <p class="card-text">CHRIST (Deemed to be University) was born out of the educational vision of St Kuriakose Elias Chavara (1805-1871), an educationalist and a social reformer of the nineteenth century South India. In his childhood, Kuriakose attended the village school where he studied language and elementary sciences. He entered the seminary in 1818 and was ordained a priest in 1829. St Chavara founded the congregation of Carmelites of Mary Immaculate (CMI), in 1831 with a vision to serve the marginalized and underprivileged.

            <p class="card-text">" A delightful welcome to you to CHRIST (Deemed to be University)

                It is always this time of the year which brings us great joy and hope of a new beginning. As all the campuses spiritedly gear up to welcome another batch of fresh minds into the portals of the University, I would like to welcome all of you to be part of our growth. With your vibrant thoughts and fresh ideas, you would help us manifest our University Vision of “Excellence and Service”.
                
                CHRIST is driven by the Vision, Mission, Core Values and Graduate Attributes that the Christites have assimilated as a habit. We are convinced now more than ever, when we have celebrated fifty-four golden years of our existence with fifteen years as a University doing yeoman service to Indian Higher Education and young people worldwide, that our aspiration to becoming a world class University of eminence with performance and distinction is indeed achievable. With the collective talent, dedication and accomplishments of our faculty, staff and students that define our University, we are recognized for our commitment to academic rigour, research excellence and holistic education. It is my firm belief that by harnessing our collective strengths and embracing innovation, we can make meaningful contributions to the world and the communities we exist in.
                
                At CHRIST, holistic training is of paramount importance. We believe that education here will prepare you for a highly diverse, networked and dynamic world. The whole person training facilitated here will promote academic, personal and professional development of every Christite. In short, we facilitate your growth as a diligent student, a team player, an ethical leader and a conscientious citizen.
                
                Becoming a Christite however is your responsibility. You should be a keen observer and identify opportunities that will benefit you and help you grow, as CHRIST offers you plenty of opportunities, choices and chances. Have the confidence to be a good team player, have shared visions for attaining your goals in line with institutional vision of Excellence and Service, have a productive relationship with other stakeholders of the University and be discerning in your choices and decisions.
                
                We are here to nurture a culture of curiosity, critical thinking, and ethical responsibility and wish to empower our students to become future leaders and change-makers. Let us work towards enriching ourselves with meaningful curricular and extracurricular transactions, let us make our dreams a reality and let us explore our reality and the future as a family.
                
                Dr Fr Joseph C C
                Vice Chancellor </p>
